**Limit Bot**

This bot makes a single trade, either waiting for the price to go above a certain price before selling or below a certain price before buying. Works with Binance and EVM-compatible blockchains.


**Instructions**

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't already.
2. Download this project and extract it somewhere nice.
3. Generate a user config file and place it inside the project folder (the same folder where "bot.bat" is located).
4. Start the bot:
   * ANY PLATFORM: Run *npm install* and then *node index.js* from within the project folder. **OR**
   * WINDOWS: double-click "bot.bat" to start the bot. If the bot hasn't been run before it will automatically install dependencies.
